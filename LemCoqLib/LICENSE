The files in this directory were originally obtained from the Lem project, possibly autogenerated by some of their tools. We did modify it minimally with the goal to get it to typecheck with recent versions of Coq. We may have introduced mistakes in that process, possibly rendering it completely useless.
The license of the upstream project can be found at
https://github.com/rems-project/lem/blob/master/LICENSE
You must abide by the requirements of that license.
